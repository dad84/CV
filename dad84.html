<span id="a">Languages</span>
<p>
  <span id="a">English :</span> (Advanced Mid) Learned it at school. Originally spoke the Slavic dialect, but years of Online communitys and hanging out with foreigners with limited commands of English have compelled me to adopt a more neutral but nevertheless steadfastly American form of English.
  <span id="a">Russian :</span> (Intermediate Mid) Took courses in high school . I'm nowhere near fluent, but not entirely incompetent, either.
  <span id="a">Norwegian :</span> (Intermediate Mid) This I absorbed through long exposure, being in Norway, and sharpened through self-study. I can speak it just barely well enough to make sense.
