  <span id="a">English : (Proficient) </span><span id="b">~></span><span id="c">$</span> Learned it at school .Originally spoke the Slavic dialect ,but years of Online communitys and hanging out with foreigners with limited commands of English have compelled me to adopt a more neutral but nevertheless steadfastly American form of English.
  <span id="a">Russian : (Intermediate) </span><span id="b">~></span><span id="c">$</span> Took courses in high school .I'm nowhere near fluent ,but not entirely incompetent ,either.
  <span id="a">Norwegian : (Intermediate) </span><span id="b">~></span><span id="c">$</span> This I absorbed through long exposure ,being in Norway ,and sharpened through self-study .I can speak it just barely well enough to make sense.

  The last project that I was working on was for one blockchain community called "XEL" , 
  that worked on a Decentralized Super computing platform .My job was to write down documentation on how too .. 
  Some tools were created by me ,such as GUI miner ,brute force wallet vanity addresses ,and many many more <a href="https://github.com/xel-software"> GitHub</a> link.
